Better Debugging: Shows detailed information about page loading and element detection
Graceful Failures: Tests continue and report findings instead of hard failing
Multiple Strategies: Tries various ways to find elements on the page
Comprehensive Logging: Shows exactly what's happening at each step

The tests will now provide detailed information about:

Whether the URL is accessible
What elements are found on the page
Alternative approaches when primary locators fail
Actual behavior documentation instead of test failures
